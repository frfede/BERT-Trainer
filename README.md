# BERT-Trainer
This repository contains a script used for the training of BERT models for text classification tasks, as used in my Bachelor's Degree Thesis

It is possibile to specify model name, dataset path, number of epochs, training and evaluation batch sizes, evaluation frequency and early stopping patience from command line.
The script uses the Transformers API from Hugging Face
